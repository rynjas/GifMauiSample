# GIF image is not working in .net MAUI application

I would like to display some gif animation images in my application. The library I used to do it with Xamarin.Forms was Xamarin.FFImageLoading.Svg.Forms. Now that we are migrating our application to .net MAUI, I see that the MAUI document says that it supports GIF files. I tried a sample, but it did not work.

I have seen a gif related bug and workaround in the following link, and I also tried it, but for me the gif animation is still not working.

I posted a question on stackoverflow, here's the link:
